## App Identity

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| HTML file | `riia-jun-release/dashboard/rita.html` — 4,000 lines. **Never read directly.** Use spec. |
| JS module dir | `riia-jun-release/dashboard/js/rita/` |
| Experience API | `riia-jun-release/src/rita/api/experience/rita.py` |
| System API | `riia-jun-release/src/rita/api/v1/system/` (one file per table) |
| Workflow API | `riia-jun-release/src/rita/api/v1/workflow/` (JWT-protected — avoid for UI reads) |
| Spec file | `project-office/specs/Spec_RITA_App.md` |
| JS Spec file | `project-office/specs/Spec_JS_Code.md` |

## File Map — What to Touch for a Typical UI Feature

| Layer | File | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | `src/rita/api/experience/rita.py` | Add read-only aggregation endpoint (Experience tier) |
| **Backend** | `src/rita/api/v1/system/{name}.py` | Add system CRUD endpoint only if the feature needs raw table access |
| **Backend** | `src/rita/schemas/{name}.py` | Add Pydantic response schema for the new endpoint |
| **Frontend** | `dashboard/js/rita/{name}.js` | Create new JS module with loader function |
| **Frontend** | `dashboard/js/rita/main.js` | Register section loader + bind window.* functions |
| **HTML** | `rita.html` | Add `<section id="sec-NAME">` with DOM elements (read HTML spec first for nav pattern) |
| **Spec** | `project-office/specs/Spec_RITA_App.md` | Update endpoint inventory + section description |

---

## Step-by-Step Task Rules

### Step 1 — Design the API Contract First
Before writing any code, define:
- Endpoint: method + path + query params
- Response shape: field names + types (write this as a Pydantic schema first)
- Frontend consumer: which JS module, which DOM element IDs

Write the contract in the task brief `[Architect] Design` section before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Add the Backend Endpoint
**Tier selection:**
- New data aggregation for the UI → Experience Tier (`src/rita/api/experience/rita.py`)
- Raw table CRUD → System Tier (`src/rita/api/v1/system/`)
- Never add read-only UI endpoints to the Workflow tier

**Experience tier rules:**
- Read-only — never call `db.commit()`, `repo.upsert()`, or `repo.delete()` in Experience routes
- Call repositories directly — no service layer needed for Experience reads
- All repos require `db: Session` — always use `Depends(get_db)`
- Return a Pydantic schema, not a raw dict

**Example pattern:**
```python
@router.get("/api/experience/rita/my-feature", response_model=MyFeatureResponse)
def get_my_feature(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    repo = MyRepo(db)
    data = repo.get_all()
    return MyFeatureResponse(items=data)
```

### Step 3 — Add the Pydantic Schema
File: `src/rita/schemas/{name}.py`
- Define request + response models
- Use field constraints: `ge=0`, `max_length=255`, `pattern=` where relevant
- Match field names exactly to what the JS frontend will read

### Step 4 — Register the Router (if new file)
In `src/rita/main.py`, include the new router with the correct prefix.
Only needed if you created a new router file — existing routers are already registered.

### Step 5 — Write the JS Module
File: `dashboard/js/rita/{name}.js`

**Module template:**
```js
import { api } from './api.js';
import { setEl, badge, fmt, fmtPct } from './utils.js';
import { mkChart, C } from './charts.js';

export async function loadMyFeature() {
  try {
    const data = await api('/api/experience/rita/my-feature');
    setEl('my-feature-value', fmt(data.value));
    mkChart('chart-my-feature', { type: 'line', data: { ... }, options: { ... } });
  } catch (e) {
    setEl('my-feature-value', '—');
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Always import `api` from `./api.js` — never use raw `fetch()`
- Always wrap API calls in `try/catch` — show `—` on error, never crash
- Use `setEl(id, html)` from `utils.js` — never `document.getElementById(...).innerHTML = ...`
- Use `mkChart(id, config)` from `charts.js` — never `new Chart(...)` directly
- Use `C` color palette: `C.run` (blue), `C.build` (green), `C.warn` (amber), `C.danger` (red)
- No `fetch()`, `console.log()`, or DOM queries at module top level — only inside functions
- Base URL from `window.RITA_API_BASE` — never hardcode `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 5.5 — FC-IMP Check: Verify Named Imports (run before Step 6)

> **Run this immediately after writing the JS module — before registering in main.js.**

For every `import { name1, name2 } from './module.js'` line in the new JS file:
1. Open `module.js` and grep for `export` statements
2. Confirm each imported name appears as `export function name` or `export const name`
3. Report explicitly: "FC-IMP: [name1] ✓ in [module.js]" — one line per import

**A missing named export is a static binding error** — the browser throws a `SyntaxError` at parse time and the entire app module tree dies, not just the new section. Do NOT proceed to main.js registration until all imports are confirmed.

If any name is missing: find the correct exported name in the file, or add the export — report the resolution. Do not silently skip a check.

**Path depth verification for cross-directory imports:**
For any import with a `..` path (e.g., `import { foo } from '../shared/api-cache.js'`), state the resolved absolute path explicitly before marking the import valid:
- From `dashboard/js/rita/`: `'../shared/'` resolves to `dashboard/js/shared/` ✓
- From `dashboard/js/rita/`: `'../../shared/'` resolves to `dashboard/shared/` — this directory does not exist
Report: "api-cache.js is at dashboard/js/shared/ → import `'../shared/api-cache.js'` ✓" — one line per cross-directory import. A wrong depth is an import resolution error that appears identical to a missing named export in browser DevTools.

### Step 6 — Register Section Loader in main.js
In `dashboard/js/rita/main.js`:
```js
import { loadMyFeature } from './my-feature.js';

// In the loader registration block:
_sectionLoaders['my-feature'] = loadMyFeature;

// At the bottom, window bindings:
window.loadMyFeature = loadMyFeature;
// Add any onclick handlers here too:
window.myFeatureAction = myFeatureAction;
```

**Rules:**
- Section id in HTML must be `sec-my-feature` (prefix `sec-`)
- Loader key is `my-feature` (no `sec-` prefix)
- Every function called from `onclick=""` in HTML must be on `window.*`

### Step 7 — Update the Spec

> **STOP — do not run `git add` until this step is complete. This is a blocking gate — spec not updated = orchestrator will re-invoke you to fix it before QA runs.**

File: `project-office/specs/Spec_RITA_App.md`
- Add the new endpoint to Section 3 (Endpoint Inventory) under the correct tier
- Add the new JS module to Section 2 (Module Structure)
- Add API→JS consumer mapping to `Spec_JS_Code.md` Section 9

Open each spec file. Read the relevant table. Add the new row. **Report the exact line you added to each file** (e.g. `| GET | /api/experience/rita/my-feature | MyFeatureResponse |`).

Then run: `grep -n 'YOUR_ENDPOINT_PATH' project-office/specs/Spec_RITA_App.md` (substitute the actual endpoint path from your API contract) and include the grep output line in your report. If grep returns no match, you have not saved the edit — do not proceed to commit until grep confirms the row exists.

### Step 8 — TechWriter: Confluence + Human Score Prompt

> **STOP — before closing the run, confirm `Spec_RITA_App.md` and `Spec_JS_Code.md` reflect the new endpoint and module. If the Engineer skipped Step 7, do it now before emitting the human score prompt.**

After confirming spec files and updating Confluence, ask the user to run a smoke test before scoring:

> **Smoke-test gate:** "Please open the RITA dashboard in a browser and verify the new section renders without JavaScript console errors. Open browser DevTools → Console and confirm no `SyntaxError`, `Cannot resolve module`, or `is not exported` errors appear. Report: page loads OK / page broken."
>
> If the user reports a runtime error: do NOT emit the scoring prompt. Investigate and fix the error first — it is likely a missing named export (FC-IMP) or a conflict marker (FC-MERGE). Only emit the scoring prompt after the user confirms the page loads cleanly.

Once the user confirms the page loads, emit the following prompt:

```
=== Agent Run Complete — Please score this run ===
Output accuracy (1–5, where 5 = exactly what was needed): _
Relevance to stated intent (1–5): _
Did PM + Architect decompose the task correctly first time? (y/n): _
Overall satisfaction / CSAT (1–5): _
Estimated hours this would have taken manually: _
Press Enter to skip any field.
=========================================
```

Record responses as `human_score{}` in the run JSON: `accuracy`, `relevance`, `planning_ok` (y→true), `csat`, `time_saved_hours`. Skipped fields default to `null`.

## Guardrails

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Never read `rita.html` directly | File is 4,000 lines. Use `Spec_HTML_Code.md` and spec section descriptions. |
| Never hardcode lot sizes or config values | Read from `settings.instruments.*` or `config_overrides` table |
| Never call `db.commit()` in Experience tier | Experience routes are read-only by design (ADR-001) |
| Never use bare `pd.read_csv()` | Always use `load_nifty_csv()` or `load_instrument_data()` from `core/data_loader.py` |
| Never call a repo directly from a Workflow router | Workflow tier uses service layer; System tier uses repo-per-router |
| Never add `print()` statements | Use `structlog` for logging |
| Never hardcode `http://localhost:8000` in JS | Use `window.RITA_API_BASE` |
| HTML changes are still required even though full reads are forbidden | "Never read rita.html" = no full-file Read (4,000 lines). For any HTML file in the Architect's files-to-touch list: use Grep to find a sibling element ID, read ±15 lines around it, then use targeted Edit to insert. Skipping an HTML change is a partial implementation (FC-PARTIAL-IMPL). |
| **Alembic migration must be applied, not just created** | After writing a migration file, run `python -m alembic upgrade head` from `riia-jun-release/` and confirm the `Running upgrade` line before committing. Committing the file alone does NOT apply the schema change — the app will crash with `OperationalError: no such column` at runtime. This is a hard DoD gate: migration applied = confirmed upgrade output seen. |
| Never call `new Chart(...)` directly | Always use `mkChart(id, config)` from `charts.js` |
| Never expose ES module functions without `window.*` | `onclick=""` handlers silently fail if not on `window` |
| Always update spec when contract changes | Spec drift breaks future agents |

## Definition of Done

Before marking this task complete, verify each item:

**FC-004 gate — verify before committing:**
Open the JS module you just wrote or changed. List every `data.field` or `r.field`
access in the file. For each, confirm the exact field name exists in your Pydantic
schema or response dict. A single character difference (underscore vs camelCase,
_pct suffix missing) causes a silent JS render failure. Only after verifying every
field may you proceed to git add.

**FC-IMP gate — JS named-import resolution (verify before committing):**
For every `import { name1, name2 } from './module.js'` line in the new or modified
JS file, open `module.js` and confirm each name appears in an `export` statement.
A missing named export is a **static binding error** — the browser throws a
`SyntaxError` at parse time, which cascades up the import chain and kills the entire
app, not just the new section. This check must be done explicitly; it is not caught
by the FC-004 contract check or by ruff.

Also verify path depth for cross-directory imports: from `dashboard/js/rita/`, shared
modules are at `'../shared/api-cache.js'` (one `..` up to `js/`). Using `'../../'`
resolves to `dashboard/` which contains no `shared/` subdirectory.

**FC-TIER gate — system-tier API compliance (run before `git add`):**
Run: `grep -rn "api/v1/training-history\|api/v1/backtest-daily\|api/v1/risk-timeline" dashboard/js/rita/`
Output must be empty. Any match = banned system-tier call still in JS. Replace with the correct experience-tier path (`/api/v1/experience/rita/...`) before committing.

**FC-API-SIG gate — api() POST signature (run before `git add`):**
Run: `grep -rn "api(.*{" dashboard/js/rita/`
Output must show zero instances of `api(path, {` patterns. All POST calls must use the positional form: `api(path, 'POST', body)`. The object-options form silently breaks all POST operations.

**FC-MERGE gate — no leftover conflict markers (run before `git add`):**
Run: `grep -rn "^<<<<<<\|^=======\|^>>>>>>>" dashboard/js/`
Output must be empty. Any `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` left in a JS file is a
`SyntaxError` that kills the entire app module tree — the browser cannot parse these
tokens. This is especially critical after merge conflict resolution sessions.

- [ ] **API contract matches** — Pydantic schema field names match JS `data.field` reads exactly
- [ ] **Experience tier is read-only** — no `db.commit()` calls in the new route
- [ ] **Section loader registered** — `_sectionLoaders['name'] = loadName` in `main.js`
- [ ] **Window bindings set** — all `onclick` handlers exposed on `window.*` in `main.js`
- [ ] **Error handled** — `try/catch` in JS loader; shows `—` on failure, no crash
- [ ] **Spec updated** — endpoint added to `Spec_RITA_App.md` Section 3; JS module added to `Spec_JS_Code.md` Section 2. **"n/a" is ONLY valid if the Architect's files-to-touch table lists zero spec rows** — any other "n/a" is FC-001 and triggers orchestrator re-invocation.
- [ ] **HTML changes complete** — every HTML file in the Architect's files-to-touch table is edited via Grep → read ±15 lines → targeted Edit. If Architect listed zero HTML files, write "n/a". Skipping = FC-PARTIAL-IMPL.
- [ ] **Ruff passes** — `ruff check src/` returns no errors
- [ ] **No hardcoded values** — no localhost URLs, no hardcoded lot sizes or config values
